each other.</FONT></P><FONT face="Bookman Old Style">
<P><B>Local Area Network (LAN)</B> is a network of computers in close proximity

<P><B>Application Layer</B> is the window for application processes to access 
the network services.</P>
<P><B>Presentation Layer </B>translates data and converts the format used to 
exchange data among networked computers. (This is sometimes known as the Network 
Translator). It manages Network Security issues by providing data encryption. It 
provides rules for data transfer and provides compression to reduce the number 
of bits being transmitted. It has a utility known as the Redirector that 
redirects I/O operations to resources on a server.</P>
<P><B>Session</B> establishes, manages and terminates network sessions between 
different computers. Performs name recognition and security functions. Provides 
synchronisation between user tasks by placing checkpoints in the data stream. 
Implements dialogue control to regulate which side transmits.</P>
<P><B>Transport</B> ensures delivery of error free messages splits up large and 
joins small messages into manageable packets in order to transmit them 
efficiently over the network. </P>
<P><B>Network</B> responsible for addressing messages and translating logical 
names &amp; addresses into physical addresses. Also determines the route to the 
destination computer. Manages traffic problems on the network such as switching, 
routing, and controlling the congestion of data.</P>
<P><B>Data-Link</B> turns packets into raw data and vice versa, handles data 
frames between the network and physical layers, responsible for error-free 
transfer of data frames via the physical layer. It defines the method to 
transmit and receive data on the network.</P></FONT><FONT

<P><B>Physical</B> transmits raw data over the network via cables 
(electrical/optical) or possibly radio waves. Defines cables, cards and other 
physical aspects such as NIC attachments to hardware. Defines techniques 
(encoding and synchronisation) to transfer raw data through the cable. Adds 
information to the front and end of the data frames, these are known as frame 
preamble and frame postamble. </P>

<P>Twisted Pair connectors </P>
<P>Coaxial</P>
<P>Fibre-Optic</P>
<P><B>Twisted Pair</B> consists of 2 insulated strands of copper wire twisted 
together.</P>
<P><B>Unshielded twisted pair</B> is used by telephone systems and if it is of a 
sufficient grade it can be used on networks.</P>
<P><B>Shielded twisted pair</B> is less susceptible to interference and carries 
signals for 100 meters.</P>
<P><B>Coaxial</B> consists of a conductive centre wire, with a wire mesh 
surround.</P>
