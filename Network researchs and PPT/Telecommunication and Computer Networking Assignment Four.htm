<H3>Chapter 7. Network Layer</H3>
<OL type=1>
  <LI value=4>
  <P align=justify>Describe three types of decentralized routing. What are the 
  advantages and disadvantages of each?</P>
  <P align=justify>Static Routing. The routing table is developed by the network 
  manager and will be modified only when a computer is added to or removed from 
  the network. The network manager uses Routing Information Protocol to develop 
  the routing table. The advantage of static routing is that it will not take 
  too much network resource to develop and maintain the routing table. The 
  disadvantage is that it cannot adjust the route to the network traffic.</P>
  <P align=justify>Dynamic Routing. To improve network routing performance, 
  dynamic routing keeps updating the fastest possible route so that the messages 
  sent can avoid the heavy traffic on the network. The advantage is that the 
  messages always go the fastest possible route in the network. However, in 
  order to do so, it needs more processing time by each computer in the network 
  and the transmissions of the status information slow down the network.</P>
  <P align=justify>Broadcast Routing. Broadcast routing does not do routing. It 
  simply sends the message to all computers in the network. The message is 
  processed only by the computer that the message is addressed to. This routing 
  is typically used only in bus networks. The advantage is that no resource is 
  wasted to process or maintain the routing information. The disadvantage is 
  that the security might become a problem and each computer in the network 
  wastes time to receive the messages and exams if the message is addressed to 
  it.</P>
  <LI value=5>
  <P align=justify>What are the differences between connectionless and 
  connection-oriented routing?</P>
  <P align=justify>Connectionless routing. In this routing, each packet is 
  treated as an individual message and each can choose its own route to the 
  destination. Thus, it is very likely that a message of more than one packet is 
  sent through many different paths. Because the packets on different paths may 
  be transmitted with different speeds, the packets arrived may not be in the 
  same order as they are sent. Therefore, there must be a sequence number in 
  every packet in order to identify the orders of the packets. The destination 
  computer has to perform the reassembly to obtain the entire message.</P>
  <P align=justify>Connection-oriented routing. In this routing, a virtual 
  circuit is established between the sender and the receiver. It is looks as if 
  there is a point-to-point connection between the two computers. The packets of 
  a message follow the same route all the way to the receiver. For the route is 
  unique, the packets must arrive in the order that they are sent. Therefore, 
  there is no need to put sequence numbers in the packets and the reassembly is 
  much easier.</P>
  <LI value=23>What is the primary problem with SNA? 
  <P align=justify>SNA, Systems Network Architecture, is a proprietary 
  architecture and protocols for network developed by IBM. It uses non-standard 
  protocols at the network layer and above that makes it incompatible with the 
  OSI model. The primary problem with SNA results from its incompatibility. For 
  it is a proprietary architecture, it is very difficult to integrate SNA 
  networks with any other network that use the standard network protocols. 
  Routing messages requires special equipment to achieve the goal. For this 
  reason, some network managers have to build both SNA network and standard LAN 
  network in the same office in order to use the two types of network 
  architecture.</P></LI></OL><BR>
<H3>Chapter 8. Local Area Networks</H3>
<OL type=1>
  <LI value=4>
  <P align=justify>Describe the distinctions made between the different types of 
  LANs.</P>
  <P align=justify>Dedicated Server Networks. A Dedicated Server Network has one 
  or more computers dedicated to provide access to files or network resources 
  such as printers and communication equipment. A dedicated server is a powerful 
  computer that provides the aforementioned service to any other computer in the 
  network. The most common type is file servers. They provide access to numerous 
  files and manage the addition, modification and deletion of the files. Another 
  popular server type is print server. A print server process all printing 
  requests in the network so that the other computers can save their power or 
  resources for processing data. Communication server is another type of server 
  that processes network communication work. For those servers handle most of 
  the common works, the other computers can focus their processing ability in 
  the usage of the applications. Dedicated server networks can connect with 
  almost any other type of network.</P>
  <P align=justify>Peer-to-Peer Networks. In a peer-to-peer network, there is 
  not a single computer that handles sophisticated work for the network 
  environment. Each computer in the network is equivalent to any one else. Each 
  computer in the network processes whatever it needs to process. They only 
  communicate with other computers when they need information that is stored in 
  other computers. In this type of network environment, any computer can share 
  their storage devices as well as output devices to the other computers.</P>
  <P align=justify>Zero-Slot LANs. Zero-slot LANs work like peer-to-peer LANs, 
  only they have the least capability comparing to the aforementioned two 
  networks. A zero-slot LAN does not need network interface cards. The zero-slot 
  LAN adapters are simply plugged into serial or parallel ports. Therefore, they 
  will not take precious slots which can be left for other devices. However, for 
  this reason, the LAN will have less efficiency and cannot perform very 
  sophisticated works.</P>
  <LI value=12>Briefly describe CSMA, CD, and CA. 
  <P align=justify>CSMA, Carrier Sense Multiple Access. This is a system used in 
  contention networks. The computers in the network listen to the network and 
  detect the exist of a carrier. If the network is silent, which means there is 
  no carrier in the network, the computer can then send messages. This system 
  usually works with collision detection or collision avoidance to perform the 
  network access control.</P>
  <P align=justify>CD, Collision Detection. Before or when sending message, the 
  computer detects that if there is collision detection in the network. If there 
  is not, the computer can send the message. If a collision happened, that means 
  the message sent is not successful. The computers have to wait for a random 
  period of time until the network is not occupied and then resend the 
  message.</P>
  <P align=justify>CA, Collision Avoidance. This protocol sends a small packet 
  prior to the message to detect if a collision happens. The advantage of this 
  protocol is that if a collision does happen, the computer wastes only a tiny 
  amount of time of sending the packet. The recovery from collisions is 
  faster.</P>
  <LI value=14>
  <P align=justify>Define the terms 1Base5, 10Base2, 10Base 5, 10Broad 36, and 
  10BaseT.</P>
  <P align=justify>1Base5. This is the coaxial cable that is used for 1M bps 
  baseband transmission and the signals can last as long as 500 meters.</P>
  <P align=justify>10Base2. This is the coaxial cable that is used for 10M bps 
  baseband transmission and the signals can last as long as 200 
  meters(185meters, to be precise).</P>
  <P align=justify>10Base5. This is the coaxial cable that is used for 10M bps 
  baseband transmission and the signals can last as long as 500 meters.</P>
  <P align=justify>10Broad36. This the coaxial cable that is used for 10M bps 
  broadband transmission and the signals can last as long as 3600 meters.</P>
  <P align=justify>10BaseT. This is the twisted pair wires that are used for 10M 
  bps baseband transmission and the signals can last as long as 100 meters.</P>
  <LI value=28>
  <P align=justify>What is Ethernet? How does it work? What is token ring? How 
  does it work?</P>
  <P align=justify>Ethernet is a network of bus topology. Every computer in the 
  network is connected to the central circuit. There are two terminators located 
  at the two ends of the circuit to provide the reflection of the signals. Due 
  to the convenience of the maintenance, the physical topology of an ethernet 
  LAN usually appears to be the in star topology. The media access control 
  protocol is CSMA/CD. In a few users and low usage environment, it provides a 
  very good performance.</P>
  <P align=justify>Token Ring is a network of ring topology developed by IBM. 
  Every computer in the network is connected to the central ring circuit. Due to 
  the convenience of the maintenance, the physical topology of a token ring LAN 
  also appears to be in star topology. The media access control is achieved by 
  utilizing tokens. A token is transmitted in the circuit to indicate the status 
  of the network. If a computer receives a free token, it has the right to send 
  messages. If it does not have any message to send, it simply passes the token 
  to next computer. If the computer has messages to send, it changes the status 
  of the token and attaches the message to the token. It then sends the token to 
  next computer. When a computer receives a busy token, it exams if the token is 
  addressed to the computer. If the message is for the computer, the computer 
  gets the message and sends an acknowledgment back to the sender. If the 
  message is not for the computer, it simply passes it to next computer. Token 
  ring networks have better performance than ethernet networks when the network 
  has a lot of users and higher usage. </P></LI></OL><BR>
<H3>Chapter 9. Metropolitan and Wide Area Networks</H3>
<OL type=1>
  <LI value=4>What happens to messages when a PAD facility is used? 
  <P align=justify>PAD, Packet Assembly and Disassembly, is a device to divide a 
  message into smaller packets and reassemble the packets to a message. When a 
  message goes through a PAD, it is disassembled into packets according to 
  specific protocols. Every packet is attached with certain information for 
  routing and reassembling purpose. When the packets arrive at a PAD, the PAD 
  collects all packets and assembles them to a message. The message then is sent 
  to processed by the receiver.</P>
  <LI value=15>Discuss why frame relay might replace X.25. 
  <P align=justify>Frame relay has three major differences from X.25.</P>
  <P align=justify>First, frame relay does not perform error control. It checks 
  for errors and discards the messages if errors are found. The applications 
  have to deal with the error correction as well as lost messages.</P>
  <P align=justify>Second, frame relay uses variable length packets, called 
  frames. The frames can be up to 8K bytes and have only 48 overhead bits. The 
  transmission rate of information bits is higher.</P>
  <P align=justify>Third, frame relay allows computers to negotiate a committed 
  information rate and a maximum allowable rate. A committed information rate is 
  the guarantee of minimum transmission rate when network is busy. A maximum 
  allowable rate is the maximum possible transmission rate.</P>
  <P align=justify>Due to the aforementioned three differences, frame relay 
  provides better performance and higher efficiency. Frame relay networks are 
  usually many times faster than X.25 networks. Therefore, frame relay might 
  replace X.25 in the near future.</P>
  <LI value=16>Discuss why ATM might replace frame relay. 
  <P align=justify>ATM, Asynchronous Transfer Mode, is pretty like frame relay. 
  It utilizes packet switched technique and error control is the responsibility 
  of the destination computer. Maximum transmission rate is negotiable. However, 
  there are three major differences that makes ATM a better transmission 
  technique than frame relay.</P>
  <P align=justify>First, ATM uses fixed length packet, called cell, to transfer 
  messages. A cell is 53 bytes long with a 5-byte overhead. Small packet is more 
  suitable for voice transmissions for it is easier and faster to reassemble and 
  route. Also, lost of a packet has very little effect on voice messages.</P>
  <P align=justify>Second, ATM circuits can be multiplexed into faster ones. 
  Therefore, ATM can provide transmission rate as fast as SONET. The 
  transmission rate can be 1.5M bps all the way up to 622.08M bps. Also, ATM is 
  able to be scaled down to what fractional T-1 provides. It is scaleable.</P>
  <P align=justify>Third, ATM provides forward error correction so that the 
  receiver can perform error correction if an error occurred instead of asking 
  for resend the message. This prevents some packets from discarded. However, it 
  works only if the errors are single-bit ones.</P>
  <P align=justify>Due to the aforementioned differences, ATM can provide better 
  and faster data transmission than frame relay can do. Therefore, ATM has the 
  advantages to replace frame relay.</P></LI></OL>
