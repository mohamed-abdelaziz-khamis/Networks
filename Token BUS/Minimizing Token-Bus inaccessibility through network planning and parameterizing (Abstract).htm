<H1>Minimizing Token-Bus inaccessibility through network planning and 
parameterizing</H1><EM>José Rufino and Paulo Veríssimo</EM> 
<P>From the Proceedings of the EFOC/LAN92 Conference, IGI, June 1992, Paris, 
France.

<H2>Abstract</H2>Local area networks have long been established as a basis for 
distributed systems. Continuity of service and bounded and known message 
delivery latency are requirements of a number of applications, which are 
imperfectly fulfilled by standard LANs. 
<P>One key issue with this regard is that LANs are subject to failures, namely 
partitions. Every single LAN displays a number of causes for partition, not all 
of them of physical nature: bus contention, ring colapse, token loss, etc. Since 
most applications can live with temporary glitches, reliable real-time operation 
is possible on non-replicated LANs, provided that these temporary partitions are 
time-bounded. We call these periods of inaccessibility, to differentiate from 
classical partitions. 
<P>This paper investigates how network planning and parameterizing policies can 
contribute for the minimization of inaccessibility periods in ISO 8802/4 
Token-Bus LANs.
