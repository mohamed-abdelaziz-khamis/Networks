    <TD><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times">On a local area network 
      such as carrier-band, the cable system is shared by all the stations on 
      the network. Any station can transmit; all stations can receive what is 
      being transmitted. The shared cable is like a telephone party line. There 
      are two questions that have to be answered for a shared cable:
      <P>1. Which station can transmit at what time? Two stations cannot 
      transmit at the same time or the signals will be garbled.</P>
      <P>2. For whom is the transmission intended? Every modem receives every 
      transmission, but the transmission is intended for only one particular 
      station.</FONT><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"></P>

      cable, all the stations must follow the same rules. These rules are called 
      a <B>protocol. </B>For the modems described in Section 3, the protocol 
      consists of the data rate and the way that ones and zeros are represented 
      by the FSK signals on the cable. All the stations have to send data at the 
      same rate and represent ones and zeros by the same kinds of signals; 
      otherwise the stations cannot communicate. Another protocol determines 
      which station is allowed to transmit. how much data that station can send 
      at a time, and which station uses the data that is received by every 
      station.</P></FONT><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">

      cable is shared, no one station may transmit all the time. Instead, a 
      station sends data in chunks called <B>frames. </B>A frame is a sequence 
      of contiguous bits that can be up to 8214 bytes long. In data 
      communications terminology, an 8-bit byte is called an 
      <B>octet.</B></P></FONT><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">

      width=10><BR><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times">On a shared 
      cable, when one station transmits a frame, all stations receive this 
      transmission. However, the frame is intended for only one specific 
      station, so there must be a way to identify each station. Therefore, a 
      unique <B>address </B>is assigned to each station, like a number on a 
      house. Each station knows its own address.</P>
      <P>The transmitting station puts address information into the frame as 
      part of the data in the frame. This information is like the house number 
      in the address on an envelope. The part of the frame that has the address 
      data is called the <B>address field. </B>The address field is 12 octets 
      long. Six octets are used for the <B>destination address, </B>the address 
      of the station for which the frame is intended; six octets are used for 
      the <B>source address, </B>the address of the station transmitting.</P>
      <P>All the stations on the network receive each frame. Each station 
      examines the received frame to see if the destination address contains its 
      address. If the address does not match, the frame is discarded; if the 
      address matches, the frame is kept.</FONT><FONT

      width=10><BR><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times">When a cable 
      system is shared, a protocol is needed to determine which station has the 
      right to transmit, or to access the medium, at any given time. If two 
      stations transmit at the same time, there is a <B>collision, </B>i.e., the 
      data is garbled. A protocol is needed to eliminate collisions.</P>
      <P>For factory applications, medium access protocol must allow the user to 
      calculate, for any given network, how long it will be, in the worst 
      collision case, before any given station has the right to transmit. If the 
      network access time can be calculated, the network is called 
      <B>deterministic. </B>Deterministic networks are needed to control 
      real-time processes. The <B>token passing </B>network protocol for media

      the network. Some stations that get the token will transmit normal data; 
      stations that have no data to transmit will simply pass the token on to 
      the next station. All stations participating in the token passing form a 
      <B>logical ring </B>as is shown in Figure 4-1.</P></FONT><FONT

      <P>Stations 235, 118, 73, 57, 26, 14,235... pass the token to each other 
      in that order. The token is passed from a higher-addressed station to a 
      lower one. The lowest-addressed station passes the token to the 
      highest-addressed station. The time it takes for the token to be passed 
      around the logical ring is called the <B>token rotation time. </B>For ease 
      of explanation, the stations have been arranged in a circular placement on 
      the cable. However, this need not be the case in a real network. Any 
      station on the cable can have any address so long as it is unique. 
      Stations 51 and 179 are not on the logical ring. They can receive frames 
      but cannot send them. The basic token-passing protocol is simple, but 
      there are a number of problems that have to be considered.</P><B>
      <P>Problem 1: </B>What if a station on the logical ring fails and cannot 
      receive the token?</P><B>
      <P>Solution: </B>Each station knows not only the next station's address 
      but also the previous token-holder's address. If a station tries to pass 
      the token to its successor, but hears no subsequent activity on the 
      medium, then it tries again. If again it hears no activity it sends out a 
      <B>who__follows </B>frame asking for the successor of the failed station. 
      The successor of the failed station then sends a <B>set__successor 
      </B>frame identifying itself to the token holder. The station holding the 
      token now knows a new successor and passes the token to it.</P><B>
      <P>Problem 2:</B> How does a new station get into the logical ring?</P><B>
      <P>Solution: </B>Periodically, a station holding the token will send out a 
      <B>solicit__successor </B>frame asking if there are other stations that 
      want to get in on the logical ring. The solicit-successor frame creates a 
      <B>response window. </B>The response window is a period of time during 
      which the token-holding station can accept an additional member of the 
      logical ring. If another station does want to get into the logical ring, 
      it sends back a <B>set__successor </B>frame and lets the token holder know 
      that it is the next successor.</P><B>
      <P>Problem 3: </B>What if a number of stations want to get into the 
      logical ring at the same time during a response window?</P><B>
      <P>Solution: </B>If a number of stations want to get into the logical ring 
      during a response window, they will all send out the set-successor frame, 
      there will be a collision, and the soliciting station will get a garbled 
      message. The station holding the token senses the collision and sends out 
      a <B>resolve__contention </B>frame. After this frame, the stations that 
      want to get in on the logical ring <B>contend </B>for the privilege of 
      getting into the logical ring in an orderly manner. Before describing how 
      this contention proceeds, a characteristic of the network must be 
      defined.</P><B>
      <P>Slot time </B>is the longest amount of time any station needs to wait 
      for another station to respond. This delay is equal to the time it takes 
      for a <B></B>signal from the initiating station to propagate over the 
      cable and be received by the addressed station, for the addressed station 
      to send out a response frame, and for the response frame signal to 
      propagate back over the cable again. In any given network, the slot time 
      must be calculated and put into each station as a network parameter.</P>
      <P>Signals on the cable travel at about 82% of the velocity of light. This 
      means that a meter of cable delays a signal about 4.1 nano-seconds. The 
      typical delay of a single station's response is about 10 micro-seconds. A 
      network with a 500 meter long cable system would have a slot time of:</P>
      <P>2 <FONT face=Symbol>´</FONT> (500 <FONT face=Symbol>´</FONT> 4.1 <FONT 
      face=Symbol>´</FONT> 10<SUP>-9</SUP>) + 10 <FONT face=Symbol>´</FONT> 10-6 
      = 14 micro-seconds</P>
      <P>Since the carrier-band network operates at 5 Mbits/second, each bit 
      time is 0.2 microseconds and each octet time is 1.6 micro-seconds. The 
      slot time in octets then becomes</P>
      <P>14/1.6 = 8.75 octet times</P>
      <P>Now back to contending for the logical ring.</P>
      <P>During contention, all the stations that want to get into the logical 
      ring listen for signals on the medium for 0, 1, 2, or 3 slot times. The 
      amount of time a station waits is determined by taking the first pair of 
      bits from its own address and determining the 0, 1, 2, or 3 slot times 
      from that binary number. If a contending station hears no other station 
      transmitting, then it sends a <B>set__successor </B>frame. This frame is 
      one slot time long to the token holder. If a contending station hears 
      anything during the time that it listens, that station eliminates itself 
      from the contention. In this way, only one station gets into the logical 
      ring every time the <B>resolve__contention </B>frame is sent.</P>
      <P>If two stations have an identical first pair of bits in their 
      addresses, then the stations will collide again. In this case, the 
      procedure is repeated using the next pair of bits from the address. By the 
      time all 48 bits of addresses are used, the contention is resolved, 
      because eventually a pair of address bits for the two contending stations 
      is different and only one station is admitted into the logical 
ring.</P><B>
      <P>Problem 4:</B> How does the logical ring get started initially? Or, 
      what if a token gets lost?</P><B>
      <P>Solution: </B>If a station is connected to the medium and hears no 
      signals, or if the station has been in the logical ring but now does not 
      hear any activity on the medium, then the token is presumed to be lost. 
      The station now sends out a frame that says it is claiming the token. This 
      <B>claim__token </B>frame is 0, 2, 4, or 6 slot times long (based on pairs 
      of bits from the station's address). If, after sending out the 
      <B>claim__token </B>frame the station hears no bus activity, it knows it 
      has the token. If it hears activity, it assumes some other station has 
      claimed the token.</P>
      <P>This is a simplified explanation of how the token-passing protocol 
      works. This protocol is implemented in semiconductor chips that work with 
      the microprocessors in a network station. The people buying the factory 
      automation equipment do not have to worry about the details of 
      token-passing protocol built into the station.</P>
      <P>The network manager has to know the concepts of token rotation time and 
      slot time and how to calculate them, in order to set up the network 
      correctly.</FONT><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"></P>

      width=10><BR><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times">The data frames 
      that are to be sent from a given station can be classified by their 
      importance. The important frames can be given <B>priority </B>and sent 
      first. Priority is an optional feature of any given station. Four classes 
      of priority frames can be sent. Alarm and error messages could be assigned 
      top priority. Real-time control messages could be the next priority file 
      transfers the next, and periodic messages for time-of-day and other 
      non-critical messages the last priority.</P>
      <P>A token-holding station is allowed to send all the highest-priority 
      frames it can within a time set by station management. When the time 
      expires, then the token must be passed on.</P>
      <P>For each of the lower-priority classes, a token rotation time is 
      specified by the station management. If the actual token rotation time is 
      less than the specified time, the station is allowed to send a priority 
      message.</P>
      <P>In a token bus system, the delay between when a frame is submitted for 
      transmission and when it is actually sent can be calculated for a given 
      system by knowing the number of stations, the size and frequency of frames 
      that each station generates, and the priorities of the frames. When there 
      is no load, the worst-case delay is the token rotation time. When the 
      system is heavily loaded with the highest-priority messages, the delay is 
      that of the token-passing time plus the time each station is allowed to 
      send the first-priority messages.</FONT><FONT

      <P>Because the modem's receiving electronics need time to adapt to listen 
      to the signal on the cable, each frame starts with a <B>preamble. </B>The 
      preamble is like saying "pssst" to someone before starting to talk. It 
      consists of six octets of alternating zeros and ones. Because the modem 
      can lose some of these preamble bits, the station cannot simply depend on 
      the number of preamble bits it received as an indication of where the real 
      data starts. In order for the real data to be distinguished from the 
      preamble, a <B>start delimiter </B>is used. The delimiter needs to be 
      uniquely distinguished from the data that follow. For this reason, the 
      start delimiter is made up of non-data symbols and zeros. Non-data symbols 
      do not appear within the data portion of the frame.</P>
      <P>One <B>frame control </B>octet is used to indicate the type of frame 
      being sent (a token, a data frame, or a management frame), what the 
      priority of the frame is, and other control information.</P>
      <P>The frame must indicate which station on the shared medium it is 
      intended for and which station it is sent from. This information is 
      provided by the source and destination address fields. These addresses of 
      physical stations on the medium are each 6 octets long.</P>
      <P>Data follows the addresses. Data must be in integral octets up to 8191 
      in length.</P>
      <P>The cable and the modem are susceptible to noise, which destroys the 
      data being sent. To guard against frames with corrupted data, the <B>Frame 
      Check Sequence, FCS, </B>is used. <FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman">As 
      the data bits in the frame are transmitted, the transmitting station 
      calculates the FCS code.</FONT> The FCS is attached to the end of the 
      frame. When the frame is received, the FCS is calculated again by the 
      receiving station from the received bits including the sent FCS. If the 
      result is not a particular bit pattern, then there must have been some 
      bits that were destroyed in the transmission process. Frames that have bad 
      frame check sequences are discarded.</P>
      <P>For the FCS technique to work, the receiver of the frame must 
      accurately know where the frame ends. For this reason, an <B>end delimiter 
      </B>is needed. The end delimiter is made up of non-data symbols and ones. 
      As in the start delimiter, the non-data symbols are necessary so that any 
      data sent in the data portion of the frame will not be confused with the 
      end delimiter.</FONT><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"></P>

      width=10><BR><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times">When the 
      carrier-band modem was discussed in Section 3, it was easy to identify 
      that part of the station; the modem was a box, a board, or a chip. The 
      part of the station that has just been described is not as easy to 
      identify. Some of the protocol is performed by a semiconductor chip; other 
      parts are performed by software running in a microprocessor in the 
      station. Conceptually, we can think of a "box" within the network station 
      that performs these protocol tasks, as shown in Figure 
      4-4.</P></FONT><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
      <P><IMG height=427 alt="MAC Functions" 
      src="4  Token Bus Operation  Carrier-band Network Handbook  Relcom Inc_files/figure0404.gif" 
      width=600><BR>Figure 4-4. MAC Functions</FONT><FONT 
      face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times"></P>
      <P>In a transmitting station, the "box" gets a data block from a data 
      source to send and then waits to get a token to gain access rights to the 
      shared cable. If the priority is right, the "box" then sends a frame with 
      a preamble, a start delimiter, an address field a control field, the data 
      itself, the frame check sequences, and then the end delimiter.</P>
      <P>In a receiving station, the "box" recognizes addresses and examines the 
      FCS to see if good data has been received. The "box" discards corrupted 
      frames and passes only good data blocks to a data destination "box" in the 
      receiving station.</P>
      <P>All together, this part of the network station is called the <B>Medium 
      Access Control </B>or <B>MAC. </B>MAC performs a <B>service </B>for other 
      "boxes" in the station, and it utilizes the service provided by the 
      modem.</P>
      <P>What has been described so far, the cable system, the modem, and the 
      MAC token bus protocol, is directly related to the carrier-band network. 
      Other protocols are needed to provide communication between two stations 
      on the carrier-band network. These protocols deal with how reliable data 
      transmission is achieved even when some of the frames are lost to noise. 
      The protocols also deal with how the flow of data between a sending 
      station and receiving station is regulated, and many, many other issues. 
      These higher protocols, which are the same for the factory broadband 
      network and even other types of networks, will be discussed in Sections 5 
      and 6.</FONT><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"></P></FONT><FONT
