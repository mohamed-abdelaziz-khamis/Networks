<P><B><U><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT color=#ff0000>The 
Retrospective Token Bus Protocol versus the Ethernet 
Protocol</FONT></FONT></U></B> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The Ethernet Protocol in a 
multidropped \ bussed topology ( eg. 10Base2 ) has a large and unpredictable 
data link overhead due to it's Carrier Sense Multiple Access \ Collision 
Detection access method . In large networks this can be easily 25% to 50% . The 
more units that are trying to transfer data at the same time the more the 
Ethernet crashes - the more drop outs and retries - hence the massive increase 
in data link overhead . There is also massive data link overhead with units 
waiting for the network to become available - inactive wait times . The 
Retrospective Token Bus Protocol , however , has a very low data link overhead 
of , typically , 0.25% to 0.5% and this overhead is very predictable . As such 
the Retrospective Token Bus Protocol is very suited to high network usage 
applications such as multi media networks such as domestic networks .</FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The Ethernet Protocol in a 
star topology ( eg. 10BaseT - ie. requires a hub ) using packet switching does 
not have the data link overhead of the bussed topology . However the cost of the 
network is considerably greater than a bus topology based network . The 
Retrospective Token Bus Protocol , however , has low overhead and low cost 
.</FONT> 
<P><B><U><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT color=#ff0000>The 
Retrospective Token Bus Protocol versus the Token Ring 
Protocol</FONT></FONT></U></B> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT color=#000000 size=-1>The 
Token Ring network has high unreliability . If , for example , the network has 
100 units and each unit's network interface has a reliability of 100,000 hours ( 
12 years ) then the reliability of the network is 100,000 / 100 hours -&gt; 1000 
hours ( 6 weeks ) . This inherrent problem has to be designed around . Secondly 
the Token Ring network requires more wires - usually 6 - as opposed to 2 for a 
bussed topology . The Retrospective Token Bus Protocol , however , has the very 
high reliability and low cost of a bus network .</FONT></FONT> 
<P><B><U><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT color=#ff0000>The 
Retrospective Token Bus Protocol versus IEEE802.4</FONT></FONT></U></B> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT color=#000000 
size=-1>IEEE802.4 is prospective token passing protocol . As such the token is 
passed explicitly from the current unit to the next logical unit . This results 
in a complicated and costly design . The Retrospective Token Bus Protocol , 
however , passes the token retrospectively - the next logical unit takes up the 
token rather than being explicitly passed the token . As such the Retrospective 
Token Bus Protocol is very easy and cheap to implement . Further because it 
requires very small chip space it is suited to low cost integrated applications 
such as would be found in domestic networks .</FONT></FONT> 
<P><B><U><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT color=#ff0000>The 
Retrospective Token Bus Protocol versus Wireless LAN's</FONT></FONT></U></B> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT color=#000000 
size=-1>Wireless LAN's use CSMA\CD type access protocols and are similar in that 
respect to Ethernet . They have , as such , a high data link overhead . Their 
bandwidth is , also , low . Where a cable system can easily operate at 100 Mbs a 
wireless LAN will typically operate at only 1.6 Mbs - far too low for multimedia 
applications . Further , wireless LAN's have space and hence bandwidth 
contention problems in densely populated areas such as in cities . All these 
problems produce both a reliability problem and a performance problem for 
multimedia - ie. there is no guarantee that the multimedia packets will get 
through within sufficient time . Further there is the cost factor - a 
Retrospective Token Bus connection will cost typically U.S. $2.50 per unit 
whereas a Proxim LAN , for example , will cost approximately U.S. $129 
.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT color=#000000 
size=-1>Bluetooth has all the disadvantages of a wireless LAN .</FONT><FONT 
size=-1> It is designed primarily as a point to point technology . It is 
designed as a connection point to a LAN . It is limited in distance and in speed 
. It is costly . It is good as an entry point to the <FONT

<P><B><U><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT color=#ff0000>The Token 
Bus Network</FONT></FONT></U></B> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The Token Bus Network can 
operate on a twisted pair cable at 100 Mbs or faster . Alternatively thin 
coaxial cable can be used . As such existing telephone cableing or low cost 
prefabricated cabling can be used . It would be possible to put in an 
autobauding and speed negotiation system if required , however , this shouldn't 
be required . There is no reason why , taking into account the practicalities , 
that the whole design of the physical side of the network can't be minimised 
cost wise . This includes , for example , using an RCA plug and socket instead 
of a BNC . Whilst it is common for LAN cards to use isolation transformers 
cheaper alternatives can be looked at .</FONT> 
<P><B><U><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
color=#ff0000>Development</FONT></FONT></U></B> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>I would recommend that a 
version of Token Bus Protocol 2 be used with some Token Bus Protocol 3A 
techniques . This would use the active and passive token passing , arbitrary 
unit number assignment , network based addressing and broadcast channel 
addressing . It would essentially operate as a MAC style protocol - not 
requiring any MAC level intelligence . This would minimise the design complexity 
and the IC real estate required . Care would also have to be taken to ensure 
that the Data Link Level - Media Access Control - works in all the practical 
situations - both protocol and physical wise .</FONT>

business in tying up the hotel into local area web based information and booking 
sites .</FONT>

just the Internet + Ethernet linkage network ( Internet + Local Area - printers 
etc. ) + MPEG decoding and output , with the T.V. Set Top Boxes being remotely 
upgradeable software wise . There is a very good market with the hotels - Poste 
House , Ibis , Sofitel , Hyatt , Sheraton , Hilton , Holiday Inn etc. . This is 
a good low cost way to enter the market . It has a good potential for high 
volume sales - 20,000+ per year and correspondingly good opportunity for profits 
. Investment would be about $1M to start off . Initial product would be 
available at 6 months . The main unknown is the development time of the ASIC 
with particular reference to the foundary prototyping stage - as this can vary - 
usually allow 1 to 2 months . Everything else is readilly available - The Front 
End Module is already built , the web browser can be easily purchased - <A
